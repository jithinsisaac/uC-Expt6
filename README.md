### Laboratory Experiment No. 6
 
### Objective  
To generate 8051 Interrupts using Timers & External Interrupts 
 
### Tools used  
- Software: 
  - MCU 8051 IDE 

### Experiment Outcome
-  To learn about 8051 Interrupts
-  To learn about the IE & IP register
-  To write a ISR for Timer0/1 interrupt
-  To write a ISR for External Interrupt (INT0/INT1)

### Instructions

1. Read about Interrupt functionalities of 8051 from 8051-Kenneth Ayala book
2. Use the Atmel 8051 Instruction sheet document to learn about the arithmetic instructions
